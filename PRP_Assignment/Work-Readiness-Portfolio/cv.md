## âœ¨ Reflection (STAR Technique)

**Situation:** I needed to build a professional CV for internship/job applications.  
**Task:** Compile my experience, education, and skills in a clean, formal document.  
**Action:** I used a CV template and revised the content based on peer and lecturer feedback.  
**Result:** I now have a polished CV that, and I haven't submitted to any job portals, because most job application require an addtional certificate or qualification for an adventageous application consideration which I currently don't possess.
